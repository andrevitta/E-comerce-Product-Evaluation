# E-comerce Product Evaluation

Evaluate Garnierâ€™s product   customers evaluation over e-commerce

* Identify better evaluated products
* Classify commentaries over good and bad

* Identify most used words over good and bad evaluations

# Data Aquisition

Data was collected from a major e-commerce platform using web scraping techniques and  python requests library. I've narrowed down to a specific brand of products so I could have a more reduced scope of products. Acquisition consists of accessing the main webpage using a specific query. Each product name and link was read and their specific page accessed. I was able to gather 255 products with over 5000 comments and evaluations.
