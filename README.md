# E-comerce Product Evaluation

# Overview

I worked on building a pipeline to automate all processes from data acquisition to the final visualization.

Evaluate Garnierâ€™s product   customers evaluation over e-commerce

* Identify better evaluated products
* Classify commentaries over good and bad
* Product most bought together
* Identify most used words over good and bad evaluations

# Data Acquisition

Data was collected from a major e-commerce platform using web scraping techniques and  python requests library. I've narrowed down to a specific brand of products so I could have a more reduced scope of products. Acquisition consists of accessing the main webpage using a specific query. Each product name and link was read and their specific page accessed. I was able to gather 255 products with over 5000 comments and evaluations.

The website wacs mapped and scraped for each product found and them their link was collected and stored

With the the link for each of the 255 products a loop was used to access all of them to retrieve the ratings for the specific product

Finally all comments for each product were also retrieved and stored together with their info, overall 5000 comments were stored.
